  version: 1.0.0
  description: >-
    This document describes the current API (Version 1.0) for MyDNSHost.


    You can use this guide to learn how to interact with the API yourself, or
    you can

    use one of the pre-written API libraries:


    - PHP: https://github.com/mydnshost/mydnshost-php-api (This is what the
    default frontend uses to interact with the api)


    - Python: https://github.com/mydnshost/mydnshost-python-api


    - Go: https://github.com/mydnshost/mydnshost-go-api


    ## User Authentication


    There are multiple ways that you can authenticate to the API.


    Unless otherwise documented, all end-points require authentication.


    ### Basic Auth


    Authentication with the account username/password can be done using HTTP
    Basic Auth.


    Authentication in this manner gives you full access to the account (Similar
    to as an API Key with all permissions set to true).


    If a 2FA Key is required for the account, this must be passed as a HTTP
    Header:


    ```http

    X-2FA-Key: 123456

    ```


    Devices can be saved as Trusted Devices to allow them to bypass the need to
    enter the 2FA key every time.


    This can be done by passing a `X-2FA-SAVE-DEVICE` header when logging in
    with a valid 2FA Key:


    ```http

    X-2FA-SAVE-DEVICE: Some Device Name

    ```


    The API Response will then include a device_id item that can be stored and
    used for future logins in place of the 2FA Key:


    ```http

    X-2FA-DEVICE-ID: 84FDBE2B-0FB2-461C-9E7B-31A2AF5E52F6

    ```


    If a `X-2FA-DEVICE-ID` is passed alongside the `X-2FA-SAVE-DEVICE` header
    then that device ID will be used to remember the device, otherwise the API
    will generate a new one for you.


    ### API Key Authentication


    If you have a valid API Key, this can be used instead of Basic Auth and
    offers greater control over what end points can be accessed.


    API Keys can be limited as to what they can see/do.


    - **domains_read**: Has access to `GET` on `/domains` end-points


    - **domains_write**: Has access to `POST` or `DELETE` on `/domains`
    end-points


    - **user_read**: Has access to `GET` on `/users` end-points


    - **user_write**: Has access to `POST` or `DELETE` on `/users` end-points


    You can log in using an API Key by adding the following headers:


    ```http

    X-API-User: SomeUser@example.org

    X-API-Key: ede99f46-198a-411a-b066-5f1c92a6d26d

    ```


    You can also use a domain-key, which behaves like an API key that has no
    `user_read` or `user_write` permissions, and can only interact with a single
    domain. Domain keys are linked to domains not users.


    ```http

    X-Domain: example.org

    X-Domain-Key: 9426F536-2559-4FA0-BA50-644C90B5FAE4

    ```


    These can also be used with basic auth (provide the key as the password and
    the username/domain as the username) and will behave as if they were passed
    in via the appropriate HTTP Headers.


    ### Session Authentication


    After logging in with one of the above methods, You can obtain a session
    token from the `/session` end point, and then use it for future requests by
    passing the X-SESSION-ID header instead of any other authentication headers.


    ```http

    X-SESSION-ID: 9pbobqkbiqvhll2ngia8bg0ijd

    ```


    Session tokens will expire approximately 15 minutes after they were last
    used, or if the method used to acquire it becomes invalid.


    ### JWT Authentication


    After logging in with one of the above methods, You can obtain a jwt token
    from the `/session/jwt` end point, and then use it for future requests by
    passing the it as a bearer token within the 'Authorization' HTTP Header
    instead of any other authentication headers.


    ```http

    Authorization: Bearer
    eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpYXQiOjE1NjEzMjgzMTQsImV4cCI6MTU2MTMzMTkxNCwiaXNzIjoiTXlETlNIb3N0X2xvY2FsIiwiYWNjZXNzIjpbXSwidXNlcmlkIjoiMSIsIm5vbmNlIjo2MTg2MjYxNjZ9.azz80sLue0OtRCFZS9X5A5r2Lw-k21Shdih7U5NjGk8

    ```


    JWT tokens will expire approximately 1 hour after they were issued, or if
    the method used to acquire it becomes invalid.


    ## Request-ID


    For any of the requests, you can pass a X-Request-ID header:


    ```http

    X-Request-ID: SomeUniqueID

    ```


    Which will be returned in the body of any response as a `reqid` field, this
    can be useful if performing async requests to the API. If no specific
    Request-ID is specified, one will be generated.


    ## Rate Limiting


    Requests to the API may be subject to rate limiting. The API uses standard
    rate-limiting headers to denote the rate limit information, for examples:


    ```http

    X-RateLimit-Limit: 1024

    X-RateLimit-Remaining: 512

    X-RateLimit-Reset: 1508738400

    ```


    These will show your total request limit amount for this window, how many
    requests you have remaining in the window, and the time that the limit
    resets.


    If you have exceeded your limit you will receive a HTTP Error 429 message
    instead of the usual API response.


    Different keys/users may have different limits. If you need a greater limit,
    please get in touch.

        This allows a user with the `manage_users` permission to create new
        users.


        This behaves similarly to update user except that you must pass in the
        `email` and `realname` fields.


        You can also either pass in a `password` field to set the password, or
        to simulate a user registration you can pass in `sendWelcome` with a
        value of `true`

        We support multiple types of code, 'rfc6238' (Default), 'plain' and
        'yubikeyotp'.


        If no 'type' data parameter is provided, then 'rfc6238' is assumed.


        For 'rfc6238' and 'plain', the secret will be randomly generated.


        For 'yubikeyotp' an OTP must be provided that validates against yubico
        cloud.


        If no 'onetime' data parameter is provided, then 'false' is assumed,
        otherwise the key will only be valid for a single use.

        As with other update methods, only fields that are provided will be

        Changes made with this end point do not automatically increment the

        This allows changing user access levels on the domain.


        As a general rule of thumb, you can not edit your own access level, and
        you can not set people to have an access level equal or above your own
        (Thus only users with the `manage_domains` permission can set domain
        owners.)


        There are 5 levels of access (each level has all the access of those
        below it):


        - owner - Owner has full control over the domain, there can only be 1.
        Only the owner can delete the domain.


        - admin - Domain admins can grant other users write access to the
        domain.


        - write - Write allows changing domain records


        - read - Read allows reading domain records but not changing


        - none - No access to the domain (Default)

        Domain keys behave like user API Keys, except they are limited to a
        single domain and can only be given read or write access (not owner or
        admin).


        You will need `write` level access on a domain to view or make changes
        to domain keys and will need to be authenticated as a real user and not
        using another domain key.

        Domain Hooks are web pages that recieve specially-crafted POST requests
        when certain events happen related to a domain.


        If a password is specified, the POST request will include an
        X-HMAC-SIGNATURE header signing the data that was sent.

        You can not edit the SOA from here, and the serial will be incremented
        automatically.

        If the user has the `domains_write` permission, they can use this to
        submit the records for a new challenge.


        We support normal mode or raw mode for this, and in raw mode we will
        accept the `keyAuth` with the token prepended already or not.


        In raw mode, we will calculate the desired `fqdn`
        (`_acme-challenge.<domain>`) and `value`
        (`base64(sha256(<token>.<keyAuth>))`) based on the provided `domain` and
        `token` + `keyAuth` parameters, then proceed as per normal mode.


        This will then delete any `TXT` records on the domain that match both
        the `fqdn` and the given `value` (or all if `value` is blank) and then
        create a new one with the new value (unless `value` is blank)

        This behaves the same as the non-admin end-point, and requires the
        `domains_create` permission in addition to the `manage_domains`
        permission.


        The admin version of the endpoint however also allows specifying an
        owner of a newly created domain.


        If owner is not specified, then the current user will be set as the
        owner (same as non-admin end-point)


        If owner is blank, no owner will be set.

                      Code is now requested on a separate page, and devices can
                      be saved to bypass the 2FA requirement in future), and
                      CNAME-and-other-records validation has been added.

                      Support has now been added for Domain Hooks which get
                      called whenever records on a domain are changed. There has
                      also been some minor changes to the 2FA login flow (2FA
                      Code is now requested on a separate page, and devices can
                      be saved to bypass the 2FA requirement in future), and
                      CNAME-and-other-records validation has been added.

        This is similar to `/articles` but will allow a user with the
        `manage_articles` permission to show all the articles not just those
        that are visible.


        All articles will have "title", "content" and "created" parameters. Some
        articles may include "contentfull" for additional content that can be
        displayed when viewing that specific article.

        This behaves similarly to updating an article, except that "title",

      Admin Endpoints for dealing with domains, end points under `/admin`
      require the `manage_domains` permission.


      As a general rule, anything that exists under `/domains` also exists under
      `/admin/domains` but in a less-restricted fashion. (ie, behaves as if the
      user had `owner` access to all domains and allows setting the domain owner
      access level on a domain).


      As such, to prevent documentation duplication, this section only lists
      methods where the result is different.

      These are used to display information to users after logging in.
  - name: BlockRegexes

      These are used to block names/emails/domains that match a given regex.

      Whilst every effort will be made to keep the API stable, resources
      available under this endpoint are subject to change without warning as
      required.
  - name: Custom Extensions
    description: >-
      In addition to standard DNS features, MyDNSHost also supports some custom
      record types, their behaviour is defined below.


      ## Template Records


      Record names prefixed with a `$` (such as `$server1`) are considered to be
      template records.


      They will not be exported into the public zone file but are otherwise
      validated as normal.


      They are primarily intended for use with `RRCLONE` records.


      ## RRCLONE


      `RRCLONE` records are special records that are replaced at zone-compile
      time with all active (not disabled) records matching the target provided
      (eg `$server1.example.com`).


      By default, *all* rrtypes are inserted, but this behaviour can be changed
      by adding a rrtype specifier to the start of the target, for example:
      `(A,AAAA) $server1.example.com` will only insert `A` and `AAAA` records
      from `$server1.example.com`


      `RRCLONE` records can point at any other non-`RRCLONE` record, and are not
      limited to just template records. If pointed at a template record from
      another zone file, the 2 zone files must both have a matching set of
      owner/admin/write users. This check can be passed by naming the record
      with `$public-` rather than just `$` to allow any user to reference it.
      Non-Template records are considered to be public records and can be
      referenced as such without a matching set of users.
